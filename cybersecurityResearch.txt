I have selected the Yahoo data breach in 2013 to report on. The data breach was caused by the acquisition of Yahoo by Verizon. It took place between 2013 and 2016, it was initially reported that a massive 1 billion accounts information had been accessed by a hacking group but was later then updated to say all of its whopping 3 billion accounts information had been captured by the hacking group. Despite the data breach, the deal for verizon still ended up being completed and verizon was able to conduct an investigation over how the breach happened and what was  captured by the hackers. The research concluded that users' security questions, answers, phone numbers, email addresses, and birthdays were taken, however the plaintext passwords, payment cards and bank data had not been breached. Verizon stated that they are committed to high transparency and accountability, and that they will constantly be working against future online threats. The flaw became apparent in the transition of ownership, but the network is now secured against this kind of threat, as they patched the issue as soon as they discovered it. Verizon has not specifically stated how they intend to protect their data in the future, but ensure they will always make it a top priority. Unfortunately time has not served their claim well, and I suggest not giving personal data if possible to companies who are unwilling to describe the nature of their security in depth.
